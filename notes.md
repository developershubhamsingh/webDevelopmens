This Course covers :

    HTML            => Raw structure.  
    CSS             => Look and feel.
    Javascripts     => To give Functionality.
    Bootstraps      => Responsiveness(fit to all screen).
    Basic JQuery    => Animations.

symantics tag: it is meant to be used : 
    <header> </header> , <footer> </footer> etc. 
     ex:  glass,bowl,water etc.

Block level elements :
    > Every time starts from new lines.
    > It consumes whole widht of the screen.
    > ex : paragraph tag (<p></p>) etc

Inline elements :
    > It starts in same lines .
    > It ocupies required space only.
 
note: 
    html tag has no logic where u writ the codes it start visible there but it is nesassary to write .
    ex:<header> </header> , <footer> </footer> .

    if u remove the body tag then also it will work because modern browser recognise it. but there is chances that old browser does not recognise.
    
   for html icon &times; etc.
